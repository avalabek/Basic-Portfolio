		<p> I am just testing here to see what I can do. Here is where I will write about myself, or rather, write about my bike. I need to write some more I guess I could paste in some text but it feels good to type some actual words in an actual language whose syntax I have some control of. I can't make the paragraph break.</p><br>
		
		<p>Oh, but yes I can, though I think I read that the tag I used is not best practice.  I really don't get why we can't simply be taught to swim first instead of just near-drowning and then being saved.</p>
